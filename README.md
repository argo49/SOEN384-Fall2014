SOEN384-Fall2014
================

Here you will find all the notes for the SOEN 384 course Management, Measurement and Quality Control written in beautiful markdown. Everything will be written in the wiki section of this repository (that little book icon on your right). You don't need to clone the repo to add to it, just edit wiki articles and stuff. If you need to adde images, then clone the repo, add your image to the `images` folder and push it / submit a pull request.

Let's ace this course with open source notes!
